    <article><h2>Can't thank you enough!</h2><br/>
    Thank you doesn't feel like enough. We will always be grateful for the love, care, understanding and
      compassion you have shown us.<br/>

      He has thrived and grown so much thanks to your guidance. There aren't enough words to use to thank you!<br/>

      We will be so lost without you next year but, it is thanks to you that he is ready for this next step.
      First Class will always hold a special place in our hearts.

    <article><h2>They Take The Time To Get To Know The Children</h2><br/>
    We came to First Class Preschool with our oldest in 2018 and could not imagine having
    had our boys go anywhere else. It is such a welcoming environment, the staff are warm and
    friendly while being so professional at the same time. <br/>

    They take the time to get to know the children so well which makes them feel seen and valued but also means that I can trust them
    fully to make the best choices for my child's care, day in and day out.<br/>

    They are fully committed to working with parents on any issues to support the children and help them thrive. The setting
    itself has great facilities and a brilliant outside space where they can explore, play and build.
    The children get the chance to grow things that they then eat or use in cooking and baking which
    is so great for them. <br/>

    I know my children will be sad when we're not at First Class anymore, but
    I also know we are all ready for our next steps because of the outstanding care and support
    we've received over the years.</article>

    <article><h2> First Class By Name, First Class By Nature!</h2><br/>
      I really couldn’t recommend the setting enough. My son has been attending for almost two years now,
      and the preschool has gone above and beyond since day one. He initially started a couple of mornings
      a week before increasing to three days a week and then up to five days a week. He is excited to go to
      preschool every day; he loves spending time in the setting with his friends and the wonderful staff.<br/>

      The setting provides so many enriching experiences for the children, from baking, preparing, and cooking
      food, to growing their own plants and introducing them to animals. The children have also had visits from
      local services (police, fire service, etc.) and other community groups. The preschool also arranges visits
      and activities for the children to learn about different cultural holidays and celebrations.<br/>

      There is a wonderful garden for the children to explore, as well as the inside areas that are set up with
      different activities daily. There’s a great app that is regularly updated with the day’s activities, and the
      staff are happy to provide further updates at pick-up.<br/>

      I’ll be sad in July when my son leaves the setting, but I honestly cannot praise First Class Preschool
      enough. The love, care, and expertise they have shown my son in the last two years is second to none.
      Alison, Jo, Tracey, and the team at First Class are amazing!</article>

    <article><h2>Completely Put My Mind At Ease</h2><br/>
      After moving from an outstanding nursery abroad to England,
      I was slightly apprehensive about my son’s childcare. However, First Class Preschool
      completely put my mind at ease. All my son’s nursery workers follow the child’s lead
      and truly support and encourage my little one to learn and play.<br/>

      They all treat him like family, really getting to know him. Their kindness and loving
      environment help put me at ease as a parent, knowing that my son is having the best day.
      They are also completely professional and informative as and when needed.<br/>

      My son has made tremendous progress with his numeracy skills as well as interacting and
      playing with other children. I couldn’t pick a better place.</article>

    <article><h2>The Team Has Been Fantastic</h2><br/>
      We have had two children at First Class Preschool, and their care and commitment to what they do have always been second to none.<br/>

      Both of our children have loved attending the setting, and the care and communication from the team have been fantastic. The activities
      and provisions have been so varied and engaging, teaching our children about many different aspects of the world.
      The staff are always positive and approachable.</article>

    <article><h2>We Love First Class Preschool!</h2><br/>
      Our son was born prematurely during the COVID lockdown, so he was shielded a lot and hadn't been left with anyone
      other than very close family. My nephews had both been to First Class and loved it, as did my sister, so it was the
      only option for us.<br/>

      He loves going, and I was put completely at ease. The girls are all amazing, kind, nurturing, and fun,
      and our child is thriving and a confident little boy. He is school-ready, and that is thanks to you.

    <article><h2>She Loves Going To Preschool Everyday!</h2><br/>
      Thank you so much for creating a fun, safe, and stimulating environment for our little one to
      grow and develop. She loves going to preschool every day and has grown so much in confidence.

    <article><h2>Thank you so much!</h2><br/>
      We changed to First Class when my son was just 2 due to issues with a childminder, and I have been so pleased with
      the decision. His confidence has come on leaps and bounds, and he is so happy to go in.<br/>

      They always seem to have a range of wonderful activities, and the outside area is amazing. He is always well cared
      for, including ensuring he is clean and comfortable due to still wearing a nappy. They have even been helping
      with the transition to potty training. Educationally, he seems to be getting on brilliantly.
      I have noticed a big improvement in how he interacts with
      other children. Overall, I'm thrilled to have put my child into this setting.
